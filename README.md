DropNext Shopify Service
========================

A stateless service that bridges retailer Shopify stores to the DropNext platform (`dropnext-monolith`):
* OAuth install flow,
* catalog/order webhooks,
* typed Admin Graphql calls, and
* forwarding of order events to the [`dropnext-monolith`](../dropnext-monolith).


### The stack

The tech stack is minimalistic, optimized for development velocity and AI-readiness.
Its application layer runs on the JVM and primarily uses libraries from the Kotlin ecosystem.

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
* [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) —
Lightweight HTTP server (CIO engine) and client (with OkHttp engine). Used both as the inbound
server (OAuth, webhooks, DSS REST) and as the outbound client (Shopify Admin API, monolith forwarding).
That Kotlin's defacto standard Graphql stack builds on top of KTor is the main reason this project is not
part of `dropnext-monolith` (which builds on `http4k`): to avoid dependency hell.
* [graphql-kotlin](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin) —
Compile-time-typed Graphql client. Queries live as `*.graphql` files in `src/resources/` and the
Gradle plugin generates typed Kotlin classes from them — schema drift fails the build instead of
the producing error at runtime.
* [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) —
Powerful and minimalistic (no reflection) lib for JSON. Used for both inbound Shopify payloads
and outbound monolith DTOs.
* [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) —
Generates Kotlin DTOs from [`src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json`](./src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json) (the checked-in copy of the canonical `DSS <-> monolith` contract).
Handwritten copies of those DTOs are explicitly forbidden by `ArchitectureTest`.
* [Konsist](https://docs.konsist.lemonappdev.com/) —
Kotlin-native architecture tests; enforces package-layer dependencies and the "no reflection" rule.


### Project goals

* Be a thin, stateless bridge between Shopify and the monolith — no database, no sessions; the only state is an
  in-memory cache of per-shop Admin tokens that the monolith is the durable store for.
* Discoverable and functional architecture (CTRL-click yourself to mastery).
* Quick developer cycles (fast recompiles, few dependencies, no JVM reflection).
* 12-factor principles (configuration by env vars).
* Test with **fakes**, not mocks (see [`.claude/rules/tests.md`](.claude/rules/tests.md)).

Non-goals:
* Multi-tenant session storage — the platform boundary is responsible for idempotency and dedup.
* Async/reactive/coroutines beyond what Ktor's CIO engine provides out of the box.


### Code map

All Kotlin lives under `src/dropnext/dss/` (we set `srcDir("src")` in Gradle to skip the Maven `src/main/kotlin/` prefix). Layer rules are enforced by [`ArchitectureTest`](test/dropnext/dss/ArchitectureTest.kt).

| Package | Role |
| ------- | ---- |
| [`app.kt`](src/dropnext/dss/app.kt) | `main` — reads config (env plus a local `.env`), builds the dependency graph, starts Ktor. |
| [`dssModule.kt`](src/dropnext/dss/dssModule.kt) | The one composition root: plugins and every route family; `main` and the request → response tests both install it. |
| [`dependencies.kt`](src/dropnext/dss/dependencies.kt) | Assembles `DssDependencies` (HTTP clients, services, handlers); tests override per-collaborator. |
| [`config/`](src/dropnext/dss/config) | `Config.from(env)`: every env var read once, secrets wrapped; plus the `.env` reader. |
| [`path/`](src/dropnext/dss/path) | URL path constants — `Paths` (inbound), `OutBoundMonolithPaths` (generated), `OutBoundShopifyOAuthPaths`. Single source of truth. |
| [`domain/`](src/dropnext/dss/domain) | The vocabulary every layer shares and that depends on nothing: `ShopDomain`, ids and secrets as value classes, the install report; `fulfillment/` holds the pure shipment ↔ fulfillment-order matcher and request validation. |
| [`mapper/`](src/dropnext/dss/mapper) | Shopify snapshot → monolith contract DTO (order, product, money). |
| [`workflow/`](src/dropnext/dss/workflow) | Multi-step orchestration that doesn't touch HTTP types directly: shop install, order/product sync, shipment ↔ fulfillment sync, tracking events, webhook registration. |
| [`handler/`](src/dropnext/dss/handler) | Ktor handlers — `ApplicationCall → response`: decode, validate, resolve the shop, call a workflow, map its answer. |
| [`routing/`](src/dropnext/dss/routing) | Thin Ktor route bindings — one `Route.*Routes(handlers)` function per handler family. |
| [`presentation/`](src/dropnext/dss/presentation) | Pure view layer — a report in, HTML out. No Ktor/HTTP types. |
| [`lib/shopify/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/shopify) | Shopify protocol primitives: GID helpers, `ShopifyOAuthService`, `ShopifyHmacVerifierService`, `ShopifyGraphqlService` (typed results) + its factory, the `ShopTokenStore`, webhook shop/id/topic parsers. |
| [`lib/monolith/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/monolith) | Outbound monolith client: `MonolithService` interface answering `MonolithResult`, `HttpMonolithService` impl, error body parsing, structured failure logging. |
| [`lib/json/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/json) | Shared `kotlinx.serialization` configs: `AppJson` (inbound) and `MonolithJson` (outbound). |
| [`lib/crypto/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/crypto), [`lib/logging/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/logging) | The one HMAC-SHA256 and constant-time compare; the MDC trace-id key. |
| [`lib/ktor/`](src/dropnext/dss/lib/ktor) | Ktor server glue: one `install*` function per plugin (`CallId` for the trace id, `CallLogging` with `callIdMdc`, `StatusPages`, JSON, `RequestValidation`, the `bearer` auth for the monolith), `DssError` helpers, shared HTTP client builders. |
| `src/resources/` | `.graphql` queries (compile-time-typed by the Gradle plugin), `logback.xml`. |
| `src/graphql-schema/` | Committed Shopify Admin schema (regenerated via `./gradlew graphqlIntrospectSchema`). |
| [`src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json`](src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json) | Checked-in copy of the canonical DSS ↔ monolith contract (the monolith serves it at `/openapi.json`). DTOs under `dropnext.dss.contract` and `OutBoundMonolithPaths` are **generated** from this. |


### Our preferred IDE

See [docs/setup-intellij-idea.md](./docs/setup-intellij-idea.md) for IntelliJ IDEA setup and troubleshooting.


### Running the project for development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required Shopify credentials (the app reads `.env` itself, layered over the process environment).
2. Expose the server with HTTPS (e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) and set `DSS_BASE_URL` to that origin (no trailing slash). Shopify requires HTTPS for OAuth and webhook callbacks.
3. Run the app:

   ```sh
   ./gradlew run
   ```

4. Point your browser to `http://localhost:{PORT}/install?shop=your-dev-store.myshopify.com` to start the OAuth flow.
### Build deployable containers

```sh
docker build -t dropnext-shopify-service:local .
docker run --rm --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 dropnext-shopify-service:local
```

If you set `PORT` to a different value, publish the same port on both sides (`-p 9090:9090` when `PORT=9090`).

`docker-compose.yml` provides two profiles:

```sh
docker compose up --build app                            # standard
docker compose --profile local-monolith up app-local-monolith  # DSS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MONOLITH=true, dev-only
```


### Codegen

#### Graphql (Shopify Admin API)

The project targets Admin API **`2026-04`**. Keep these in sync when changing versions:

* `graphql.client.endpoint` in `build.gradle.kts`
* `graphql.config.yml` (IDE plugin URL, if present)
* `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` env var (default in `Config.kt`)

After bumping the version, run `./gradlew graphqlIntrospectSchema graphqlGenerateClient` and fix any schema drift.

The schema is committed at `src/graphql-schema/schema.graphql` (so the IDE plugin can find it).

#### OpenAPI (monolith DTOs)

Monolith request/response bodies are **generated** from [`src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json`](src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json)
(OpenAPI 3.0, spec validation enabled in Gradle). The same spec describes both directions: the monolith
endpoints DSS calls and the DSS endpoints the monolith calls.

```sh
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```

* Generator: `kotlin` + `jvm-ktor`
* Output: `build/generated/openapi/.../dropnext/dss/contract/` (`modelPackage` is derived from `monolithContractGeneratedDtoPath` in `build.gradle.kts`)
* Policy: **Models only** (`apis=false`) — HTTP stays in handwritten `HttpMonolithService`

Do not add handwritten copies of `CreateShopifyOrderRequest` or other spec DTOs.
If codegen fails, fix the schema in `src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json` (and in the monolith that serves it), then re-run `openApiGenerate` (or any compile task).


### The JetBrains [Graphql IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097-graphql)

With this plugin, you get syntax + error highlighting and autocomplete on Graphql queries in IntelliJ IDEA.
It also lets you run queries against an endpoint directly from the IDE.

The plugin's introspection (downloading of the schema) does not work well with the Shopify Graphql API.
To mitigate, we use the Gradle plugin's introspection (the `graphqlIntrospectSchema` task) and
point the IDE plugin at the committed `src/graphql-schema/schema.graphql`.


### Shopify Partner app

* Create or use a Partner app and set **Allowed redirection URL(s)** to exactly `{DSS_BASE_URL}{OAUTH_REDIRECT_PATH}`
(default path `/oauth/callback`).
* Suggested scopes (trim to what your app actually needs; mirror in the Partner Dashboard):
  * `read_products` — catalog sync and product webhooks
  * `read_inventory`, `read_locations` — optional, if you extend inventory sync
  * `write_webhooks` — `webhookSubscriptionCreate` on install
* `read_orders` — order webhooks and `GetOrderForDss`
  * `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` (and matching `read_*`, per [access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes)) — create fulfillments and tracking from the app
* Example: `read_products,read_orders,write_webhooks,write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders,read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders`


### Hosted deployment

* **App URL**: `DSS_BASE_URL` must be the HTTPS origin Shopify uses to reach this service.
* **Listen address**: binds `0.0.0.0` so it works in containers and typical PaaS hosting.
* **Access tokens**: the server is **stateless** — it does not persist Admin API tokens.
After OAuth, the success page shows how to set `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS` so a future cold start can re-resolve the token without OAuth. Webhooks and internal REST routes resolve the per-shop Admin token through the in-memory cache (filled by OAuth, `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS`, or `PUT /stores/api-key`), falling back to a monolith `GET /stores` lookup.


### Webhooks registered on install

Subscriptions all use the same HTTPS callback: `{DSS_BASE_URL}/webhooks/shopify`.

* `PRODUCTS_CREATE`, `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`, `PRODUCTS_DELETE`
* `ORDERS_CREATE`, `ORDERS_UPDATED`

On `products/create` and `products/update`, the app parses the webhook body for the resource id and runs `GetProductById`. On `orders/create`, it runs `GetOrderForDss` and POSTs to the monolith. On `orders/updated`, the webhook is acknowledged but not mirrored to monolith.

**Shop domain:** webhooks use `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain` (forward this header through your reverse proxy). DSS logs include a per-request `trace_id` (Ktor's `CallId` plugin, put in the Logback MDC by `CallLogging` and kept across coroutine suspensions); a caller's `X-Request-Id` or `X-Trace-Id` is adopted, every response carries it as `X-Trace-Id`, and every call to the monolith forwards it as `X-Trace-Id`. A monolith error body carries the monolith's own trace id, logged as `monolith_trace_id`.


### DSS internal REST

**Canonical:** the spec the monolith serves at `/openapi.json`, checked in here as [`src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json`](src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json) (Gradle `openApiGenerate` uses it).

* `POST /sync-shipments-with-fulfillments` — accepts `SyncShipmentsWithFulfillmentsRequest` (sync DropNext shipments ↔ Shopify fulfillments).
* `POST /tracking-update` — accepts `TrackingUpdateRequest` (tracking status → Shopify FulfillmentEvent).
* `PUT /stores/api-key` — accepts `UpdateStoreApiKeyRequest`; caches the Shopify Admin token in memory and forwards it to the monolith.

The per-shop Admin token is resolved server-side via the in-memory cache (filled by OAuth, `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS`, or `PUT /stores/api-key`) with a fallback to monolith `GET /stores`. These routes require `Authorization: Bearer <DSS_API_KEY>`.


### Security notes (production)

* Use **HTTPS** everywhere between clients, monolith, and this service;
set `DSS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MONOLITH=true` only on developer machines.
* Set `DSS_API_KEY` so internal REST is not open on the network;
the header is compared in **constant time** to reduce timing leaks.
* **Secrets in env**: `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS` is as sensitive as a password —
use a secrets manager in production, not committed `.env` files.
* The HTTP client does **not** log request bodies (avoids leaking tokens to logs).
Unhandled server errors return a generic message; details stay in server logs only.


### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID` | yes | App Client ID (OAuth client id used for install flow) |
| `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | App secret (OAuth HMAC, token exchange, webhook HMAC) |
| `SHOPIFY_SCOPES` | yes | Comma-separated scopes (see above) |
| `DSS_BASE_URL` | yes | Public https origin of this server (tunnel URL in dev) |
| `OAUTH_REDIRECT_PATH` | no | Default `/oauth/callback` (must match Partner redirect URL) |
| `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` | no | Default `2026-04` (keep in sync with `build.gradle.kts` / `graphql.config.yml`) |
| `PORT` | no | Default `8080` |
| `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS` | no | Comma-separated `shop.myshopify.com\|shpat_…` pairs seeding the in-memory token store (parsed in `Config.kt`) |
| `MONOLITH_BASE_URL` | yes | **REST root URL** DSS appends segments to (`/orders`, `/stores`, `/stores/api-key`, `/product-variants`). May include a path prefix, e.g. `https://staging.dropnext.com/api/shopify-service/v1` (no trailing slash). Leave `MONOLITH_API_PREFIX` empty when the full prefix is already in this value. |
| `MONOLITH_API_PREFIX` | no | Inserted **after** base: `{BASE}/{PREFIX}/stores/api-key`. Example env `MONOLITH_API_PREFIX=api/v1`. Omit slashes at edges; empty (default) uses paths directly under base. |
| `MONOLITH_API_KEY` | no | Optional Bearer token for monolith requests (`Authorization`). |
| `DSS_API_KEY` | yes | Secret used for DSS internal REST auth (`Authorization: Bearer ...`). |
| `DSS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MONOLITH` | no | Set `true` only for local dev so `MONOLITH_BASE_URL` may use `http://`. Production should use `https://` (default: insecure URLs are rejected at startup). |
| `LOGFLARE_SOURCE_NAME` | no | Logflare source to ship logs to, e.g. `dropnext.dss` (the monolith ships to `dropnext.app`). Created through the API when it does not exist yet. Shipping needs this **and** `LOGFLARE_API_KEY`; with either missing the service logs to stdout only. |
| `LOGFLARE_API_KEY` | no | Logflare account key. Lives in AWS Secrets Manager (`dropnext/<env>/dss`), never in a repo. |
| `LOGFLARE_ENDPOINT` | no | Default `https://api.logflare.app`. Point it at a local stub to try shipping without an account. |
| `DSS_MODE` | no | `DEV` or `PROD` (default), the same switch as the monolith's `MONOLITH_MODE`. `DEV` logs one line per HTTP request (method, path, status — never the query string); useful while working on a webhook locally. |

Legacy compatibility: `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` and `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` are still accepted as fallbacks when the new `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` vars are not set.


### Troubleshooting

* **Startup exits quickly**: verify required vars `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` (or legacy `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`), plus `SHOPIFY_SCOPES` and `DSS_BASE_URL`.
* **OAuth callback mismatch in Shopify**: ensure `{DSS_BASE_URL}{OAUTH_REDIRECT_PATH}` exactly matches the Partner Dashboard redirect URL.
* **DSS auth failures (`401`)**: a bare `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header means the `Authorization: Bearer <DSS_API_KEY>` header was missing or wrong; a `401` with a JSON body means no Shopify Admin token is resolvable for the shop — seed `DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS`, complete OAuth, or `PUT /stores/api-key`.
* **`DSS_SHOP_ACCESS_TOKENS` parse issues**: use comma-separated `shop.myshopify.com|shpat_...` pairs.
* **`[monolith] MONOLITH_BASE_URL is unset` despite being configured**: duplicate `MONOLITH_BASE_URL` / `MONOLITH_API_KEY` lines (often empty trailing blocks pasted from templates) cause **last value wins**. Remove the trailing empties so only one assignment remains; redeploy/restart.
* **`Monolith store api-key … status=404` with HTML `<h1>Not Found`**: DSS hit `{MONOLITH_BASE_URL}/stores/api-key` (before optional prefix). Use the REST API domain (often `api.…`), or set `MONOLITH_API_PREFIX` if routes live under a path (`api/v1`). Confirm with `curl -i -X PUT https://your-api…/stores/api-key` (+ Bearer header) outside DSS.
* **502 Bad Gateway on `DSS_BASE_URL`**: the reverse proxy forwards to the wrong container port. The JVM binds `PORT` (see `[http] Listening …` startup line). Dockerfile sets `ENV PORT=9999`, but dashboards that add an empty `PORT=` override that with blank. Set `PORT=9999` explicitly or remove the `PORT` key so the image default wins; Traefik/nginx must target the **same** port.
* **Insecure monolith URL rejected**: set `DSS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MONOLITH=true` only for local development; production should remain HTTPS.
