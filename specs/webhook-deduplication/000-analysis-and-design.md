# Shopify webhook deduplication: analysis and design

Status: draft analysis. No numbered specs yet: they follow once the open questions below are decided.
Author: cies (with Claude)
Date: 2026-05-24, revised 2026-09-11 (moved into this folder; brought up to date with Shopify's current retry
policy, the webhook handler's outcome-based answers and a review of Caffeine as a dependency).
Repos: DSS; the monolith for layer 2.


## What runs today

- `ShopifyWebhookHandlers.handleShopifyWebhook` verifies the HMAC, runs one workflow per topic and chooses the
  answer from its `WebhookMirrorOutcome`: a `200` when a redelivery could not go better, a `502` when the outcome
  `isTransient` (Shopify or the monolith did not answer, throttled, or answered a `5xx`), so that Shopify's own
  redelivery is the retry.
- The mirrored topics, and how the monolith absorbs a duplicate of each:
  - `orders/create` → `POST /orders`: a second create is a `409`, read as `CreateOrderOutcome.AlreadyExisted`,
    which is a success.
  - `products/create` and `products/update` → the variant upsert: repeating it with the same content is a no-op.
  - `products/delete` → the variant soft-delete: idempotent.
  - `orders/updated` is acknowledged and not mirrored. The `DSS_SYNC_ORDER_ON_UPDATED` switch that the first draft
    of this document discussed was removed in June 2026.
- Every verified delivery ends in one `Webhook done … webhook_id=… outcome=…` line (`WebhookDeliveryReport`). The
  same `webhook_id` on two lines is a redelivery, so "how many duplicates did we receive" is already a Logflare
  query; what is missing is not paying for them.
- The DSS runs as one Fargate task (`enable_autoscaling = false` in `dropnext-infra/modules/app-dss-stack`), but a
  deploy starts the new task before it stops the old one (`dropnext-infra/modules/fargate-service/main.tf`), so two
  tasks serve side by side for a short while, and every deploy starts with empty memory.


## Problem

Shopify guarantees at-least-once delivery. The same delivery reaches `/webhooks/shopify` more than once when:

1. **Shopify retries.** A delivery fails when the app does not answer within five seconds; Shopify then retries
   it up to eight times in four hours, with a growing interval. After repeated failures within 24 hours it removes
   the subscription, which `/api/check` then reports as `missing`.
2. **We ask for it.** The handler answers `502` to a transient failure precisely so that Shopify redelivers.
3. **Two tasks serve at once**: during a deploy today, and all the time once the service scales out.
4. **An operator resends** a delivery from the Partner Dashboard during incident recovery.

Separately, a shop with two subscriptions to one topic at our callback URL receives one delivery per subscription.
`registerShopifyWebhooks` registers one per topic, so that only happens through a subscription made by hand.

The *correctness* defect is absorbed by the monolith's idempotency for every topic mirrored today. The *efficiency*
defect is real but modest: each duplicate `orders/create` costs a `GetOrderForDss` and a monolith round trip, each
duplicate product webhook a `GetProductById` and an upsert, and Shopify's retries are eight per failure. What is
missing is a *floor*: a future topic whose effect is not idempotent in the monolith (`app/uninstalled`, the GDPR
topics) has nothing that stops a second effect.


## Goals

1. **At-most-once effects** in the monolith for any given Shopify delivery, even across two tasks.
2. **Cheap to add**: the DSS keeps no database, and adopting one for deduplication alone would invert its
   operational model.
3. **Observable**: every dropped duplicate shows in the existing delivery line, countable by reason.
4. **Recoverable**: a delivery whose effect did not reach the monolith is never dropped as a duplicate, whether
   Shopify retries it or an operator resends it.


## Non-goals

- **Ordering guarantees.** Shopify does not deliver in order and we do not promise to process in order; the
  monolith resolves conflicts by `shopify_order_id` and timestamps.
- **End-to-end exactly-once.** That would need a two-phase commit across the DSS and the monolith; at-most-once at
  the deduplication boundary plus the monolith's idempotency is the target.


## What Shopify gives us

- **`X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`** identifies one delivery of one subscription and stays the same across its retries.
  Shopify recommends it for deduplicating deliveries, and its recipe checks a store for the id, skips a known one,
  and saves the id *after* processing.
- **`X-Shopify-Event-Id`** is the same across the deliveries of every subscription that one merchant action
  triggered. Shopify recommends it for correlating those deliveries, not for deduplicating one.
- **`X-Shopify-Triggered-At`** says when Shopify generated the event; the delivery line already reports the lag
  from it.

The key is `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`. A key on topic and resource id would also swallow a later, genuine change to the
same resource (a second `products/update` is not a duplicate), and `X-Shopify-Event-Id` would merge the deliveries
of two subscriptions, which only a subscription made by hand produces.


## When a delivery counts as seen

The first draft recorded a delivery when it was accepted, before its workflow ran. With the handler's current
answers that loses events:

1. Delivery `d` arrives and is recorded, and the monolith is down: the outcome is transient, the answer a `502`.
2. Shopify redelivers `d` with the same `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`. The cache knows the id and answers `200` without
   doing any work.
3. Shopify stops retrying. The order never reaches the monolith.

The rule instead, which is also Shopify's recipe:

- **Record a delivery only when its outcome is `Mirrored`.** A skipped or failed delivery is not recorded, so a
  retry or a resend runs it again, which is today's behaviour and safe by the monolith's idempotency. That
  includes the skips: a delivery skipped for `NO_ADMIN_TOKEN` must run again when an operator resends it after the
  app was reinstalled.
- **Mark a delivery in flight while it runs.** Shopify retries after five seconds without an answer, so a duplicate
  can arrive while the first attempt is still working. The duplicate is answered `502` without work, so that
  Shopify's next retry sees the settled state: recorded (then dropped) or cleared (then run). A delivery that ends
  in anything but `Mirrored` clears its mark. Such a `502` counts as one failed attempt towards the subscription
  removal; only a delivery slower than five seconds can cause one.


## Approaches considered

### A. Trust the monolith (what runs today)

It works for every topic mirrored today, costs a Shopify read and a monolith round trip per duplicate, and gives a
future non-idempotent topic no floor.

### B. In-memory deduplication per task

A map from `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id` to its state (in flight, or mirrored at an instant), with a TTL.

- **Pros**: no infrastructure; covers Shopify's retries and operator resends on one task; small.
- **Cons**: empty after every deploy and every restart; the two tasks of a deploy do not share it.
- **TTL**: Shopify's retries end four hours after the first failure; 24 hours also covers a resend on the same day.
  At the volume of one merchant's orders and product edits the memory is negligible either way.

### C. Shared store (Redis)

The same state in a Redis instance every task shares. It survives deploys and coordinates tasks, but it adds
infrastructure the project does not have (an operations decision, not a Gradle one) and a failure mode of its own:
with Redis down, fail closed (`502`, Shopify retries) or fail open (process, and risk a second effect).

### D. Deduplication in the monolith

A `webhook_deliveries` table keyed on `(shop_id, webhook_id)`, owned by the monolith, which already owns the data.

- **Pros**: one source of truth; survives everything; the DSS stays stateless.
- **Cons**: a round trip per delivery; work in the monolith; no help for an effect that stays inside the DSS (there
  is none today).
- **The claim has the same trap as the first draft of B.** A pre-check that inserts an `in_flight` row and answers
  `409` on any collision makes the retry of a transiently failed delivery look like a duplicate. The rules have to
  be: a collision with a `processed` row is a duplicate (the DSS answers `200` without work); a collision with a
  fresh `in_flight` row means "try again later" (the DSS answers `502`); a delivery that does not end `Mirrored`
  releases its claim; an `in_flight` row older than a staleness window (about ten minutes) can be taken over after
  a crash. Marking the row `processed` needs either a second call from the DSS or the webhook id on the monolith
  write the delivery causes; open question 5 asks which.


## Recommended approach

**Layered: B in the DSS now, D in the monolith when it is needed.**

- **Layer 1, the DSS (B).** A `WebhookDeliveryLedger` beside the handler, consulted after the HMAC check and before
  the topic dispatch, keyed by `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id` and following "When a delivery counts as seen". A delivery
  without the header is processed as today. A dropped duplicate is the outcome
  `WebhookMirrorOutcome.Skipped(WebhookSkipReason.DUPLICATE_DELIVERY)`, so it is a `200` with
  `outcome=skipped reason=duplicate_delivery` in the existing delivery line and response body. An in-flight
  duplicate is a `502` whose delivery line says so.
- **Layer 2, the monolith (D).** Worth its round trip only when one of two things happens: a topic whose effect is
  not idempotent in the monolith gets mirrored, or the DSS runs more than one task outside deploys. Until then
  layer 1 plus the monolith's idempotency covers every case that exists.

The order of work, each step independent of the next:

1. **DSS, layer 1.** The ledger and its wiring in `ShopifyWebhookHandlers`.
2. **Monolith, layer 2**, once triggered. The table and the claim endpoint, specified in `../dropnext-monolith/specs/`
   first, per the workspace rule that the provider lands first.
3. **DSS, layer 2.** The pre-check between layer 1 and the topic dispatch.


## Dependency: Caffeine or a hand-written ledger

The first draft proposed Caffeine for layer 1 and guessed it was already on the classpath through OkHttp. It is
not: `./gradlew dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath` lists no Caffeine artifact, so it would be a new
dependency, which needs human sign-off.

What adding it would mean:

- **Version**: 3.2.4 (May 2026), the latest release.
- **Transitive dependencies**: `org.jspecify:jspecify:1.0.0` and `com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:2.49.0`,
  both annotation-only jars.
- **Reflection**: yes, internally. Caffeine generates one cache class per combination of features and picks the
  right one when a cache is built, by a computed class name: `LocalCacheFactory` calls
  `MethodHandles.lookup().findClass(…)` and then `findStaticVarHandle` or `findConstructor` on the class it found,
  and its node classes are loaded the same way (issue #552). That is reflective lookup in the sense our reflection
  policy means. It works on the JVM the DSS runs on; it is also what breaks GraalVM native images unless every
  generated constructor is registered for reflection, which the DSS does not use.
- **Quality**: mature, Apache 2.0, widely used (Spring Boot, among others, integrates it), with an eviction and
  expiration engine far beyond what layer 1 needs.

What layer 1 needs: a set of at most a few thousand ids a day, each with a state and a fixed TTL, on one task. No
size-based eviction policy, no loading on a miss, no refresh, no statistics. A `ConcurrentHashMap<String, Entry>`
that drops expired entries on write (and when it grows past a cap) is about thirty lines, takes an injected `Clock`
so the TTL is testable without sleeping, and needs neither a dependency nor reflection.

**Verdict: Caffeine is a good library and a poor fit here.** Do not add it for layer 1. Reconsider it when the
service needs a real cache, bounded by size, loading on a miss or refreshed in the background (a cache of Shopify
reads, for example), where its eviction engine earns the dependency and the reflection exception.


## Test plan (layer 1)

- **Pure** (`WebhookDeliveryLedgerTest`, with a fixed `Clock`): an unknown id is not a duplicate; a mirrored id is
  one until the TTL passes; an in-flight id reads as in flight; clearing an in-flight id makes it unknown again;
  expired entries are dropped on write.
- **Request → response** (`ShopifyWebhookHandlersTest`, through `withDssApp`):
  - `orders/create` delivered twice with one `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`: the first mirrors, the second is a `200` with
    `reason=duplicate_delivery`, and `FakeMonolithService` records a single `postCreateOrder`.
  - The first delivery fails transiently (the fake monolith answers a `5xx`) and is answered `502`; the redelivery
    with the same id runs again and mirrors.
  - A delivery skipped for `NO_ADMIN_TOKEN` and redelivered after a token was added mirrors on the second run.
  - An HMAC failure does not touch the ledger.
  - A delivery without `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id` is processed as today, twice when sent twice.


## Open questions for the human developer

1. **Layer 2 outage.** When the monolith pre-check does not answer: fail closed (`502`, Shopify retries) or fail
   open (process, and risk a second effect)? Recommendation: fail closed, like the monolith write that would follow
   and would fail the same way. Keep in mind that repeated failures within 24 hours cost the subscription.
2. **Operator resends.** Does a resend from the Partner Dashboard keep the delivery's `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`? Shopify
   does not document it; try it on the staging shop. Under "When a delivery counts as seen" either answer is safe: a
   resend of a mirrored delivery is dropped, a resend of a failed one runs.
3. **TTL.** Four hours (Shopify's retry window) or 24 hours (also same-day resends)? Memory does not decide it.
4. **Event id.** Log `X-Shopify-Event-Id` in the delivery line, so that a subscription made by hand shows as two
   deliveries of one event?
5. **Layer 2 bookkeeping.** Mark the monolith row `processed` through a second call from the DSS, or by passing the
   webhook id on the write the delivery causes?


## What this document does not cover

- **Outbound retries to the monolith.** `createMonolithHttpClient` retries a request that failed with an
  `IOException` up to three times; a monolith `5xx` makes the delivery transient, and Shopify redelivers it.
- **Shopify throttling.** It surfaces as a transient `ShopifyError.HttpError(429)` or `GraphqlError`, answered with a
  `502`; unchanged.
- **`app/uninstalled` and the GDPR topics.** Layer 2 is the floor they need; what they do (drop tokens, schedule
  deletion) is a design of its own.
