# Spec: compliance webhooks and `app/uninstalled`

Status: draft
Author: cies (with Claude)
Date: 2026-09-12
Depends on: the precondition of `010` for the compliance topics (they are required of public apps). `app/uninstalled`
is worth having whatever the distribution, and does not depend on `010`.
Repos: monolith first (it holds the data and serves the contract), then the DSS; the app configuration in Shopify.


## Problem

- **Compliance topics.** An app distributed through the Shopify App Store must handle `customers/data_request`,
  `customers/redact` and `shop/redact`, and these can only be subscribed in the app's configuration, not through the
  `webhookSubscriptionCreate` mutation that `registerShopifyWebhooks` uses. Nothing subscribes them today. A delivery
  that did reach `/webhooks/shopify` would be verified and then answered `200 skipped topic_not_mirrored`, having done
  nothing.
- **Where the data is.** The DSS keeps no customer data: it is stateless and caches tokens only. The monolith does: every
  order mirrored through `POST /orders` carries the customer's shipping address, name and phone number.
- **Uninstalls.** Shopify revokes the app's token when a merchant uninstalls it. Nothing tells the monolith: it keeps the
  dead token in `stores.encoded_api_key`, keeps queuing shipment syncs and tracking updates for the shop, and each of
  them ends in a `401` (`DssError.ShopifyAdminTokenRejected`) that reads the same as a broken install.
- `specs/webhook-deduplication/000-analysis-and-design.md` names `app/uninstalled` and the compliance topics as needing
  a design of their own; this is that design.


## What Shopify does

From Shopify's privacy law compliance documentation (see "Sources"; confirm the details when this spec is picked up):

- **Who.** "Any app that you distribute through the Shopify App Store must respond to data subject requests, regardless
  of whether the app collects personal data."
- **Configuration.** The compliance topics are declared in the app configuration (`shopify.app.toml`,
  `[[webhooks.subscriptions]]` with `compliance_topics`), deployed with the Shopify CLI. Shopify also recommends that
  configuration for ordinary topics; subscriptions declared there do not show up in the Admin API's
  `webhookSubscriptions` query.
- **Answers.** A `200`-series status for a valid request; `401 Unauthorized` when the HMAC does not verify, which
  `ShopifyWebhookHandlers` already answers.
- **Deadlines.** The action is completed within 30 days of the request. `shop/redact` arrives 48 hours after the store
  owner uninstalls the app.
- **Payloads.** The shop (`shop_id`, `shop_domain`), and per topic the customer (`id`, `email`, `phone`), the orders
  concerned (`orders_requested` or `orders_to_redact`) and, for a data request, its `data_request.id`.


## What changes

### DSS

- `ShopifyWebhookTopic` gains `AppUninstalled` (registered through the API like today's topics, open question 4),
  `CustomersDataRequest`, `CustomersRedact` and `ShopRedact` (no `subscriptionTopic`: not registered by the DSS).
- `app/uninstalled`:
  - the token store drops whatever it caches for the shop (a `forgetAll(shop)` beside the token-bound `forget`);
  - the monolith is told (a new contract endpoint, open question 2), which clears the token and marks the store
    uninstalled;
  - the outcome is `Mirrored` once the monolith answered, `MonolithFailed` otherwise, so a monolith outage is redelivered.
- Compliance topics: forwarded to the monolith with the shop, the topic, the webhook id and the ids from the payload.
  The answer is a `200` once the monolith has recorded the request, a `502` when it could not (Shopify redelivers). The
  DSS never needs the Admin token for these, so they run for a shop without one.
- `WebhookSkipReason` and the delivery report labels gain nothing: each of these is mirrored or failed.
- `/api/check` and the install page report whether the shop is subscribed to `app/uninstalled`.

### Monolith

- Contract endpoints for an uninstall and for a privacy request.
- A `privacy_requests` table: topic, store, customer id, order ids, Shopify's webhook id (unique, so a redelivery
  records nothing twice), received and completed timestamps.
- Jobs: `customers/redact` removes or anonymises the customer's personal data on the named orders; `shop/redact` removes
  the store's Shopify data; `customers/data_request` produces what the store owner has to hand over (open question 3).
- The uninstall clears `encoded_api_key` and stops the shop's sync and tracking jobs from calling the DSS.

### App configuration

- A `shopify.app.toml` (or the Partner Dashboard equivalent while it exists) declaring the compliance topics at
  `{DSS_BASE_URL}/webhooks/shopify`, one per environment, since staging and production have different base URLs.


## Behavioral contract

- **Every compliance delivery is either recorded by the monolith or redelivered by Shopify**; none is acknowledged
  without being recorded.
- **Idempotence**: a redelivered compliance request or uninstall changes nothing the first delivery did not.
- **Order of effects on uninstall**: the DSS's cache is dropped even when the monolith call fails, so no request of this
  task uses a revoked token again.


## Edge cases

- **An uninstall for a shop the DSS does not cache**: forgetting is a no-op; the monolith is told all the same.
- **A reinstall within 48 hours**: whether Shopify still sends `shop/redact` is to be confirmed on a development store
  before the redaction job deletes anything.
- **Orders already passed to suppliers**: the supplier orders carry the shipping address too; what redaction means there,
  and which records bookkeeping law requires to keep, is a business question (open question 5).
- **A compliance request for a shop the monolith does not know**: recorded and answered `200`, since there is nothing
  to redact.
- **A delivery with a bad HMAC**: `401`, as for every topic.


## Reuse inventory

- `ShopifyWebhookHandlers` (HMAC verification, the per-topic dispatch, the outcome-based answer and the delivery report),
  `ShopifyWebhookTopic` and `registerShopifyWebhooks`.
- `ShopTokenStore.forget` (token-bound today) for the eviction.
- `MonolithService` plus its wire test (`TestSuiteArchitectureTest` requires one per new method) and `FakeMonolithService`.
- Monolith: the job pattern of `SyncShipmentsWithFulfillments`; the store token columns in `shopifyServiceApiWrite.kt`.


## Test plan

- **DSS, request → response** (`ShopifyWebhookHandlersTest`): each compliance topic with a valid HMAC reaches the
  monolith and is answered `200`; with a bad HMAC it is a `401` and reaches nothing; a monolith outage is a `502`;
  `app/uninstalled` evicts the cached token and tells the monolith, also for a shop without a token.
- **DSS, wire** (`HttpMonolithServiceTest`): the new calls.
- **Monolith** (`*DbTest`, job tests): a redelivered request is recorded once; each redaction touches exactly the named
  customer's data; an uninstall clears the token and stops the shop's DSS jobs.
- **By hand, on a development store**: trigger each compliance topic from the Partner Dashboard and uninstall the app;
  follow each delivery by its trace id.


## Open questions for the human developer

1. Is the app public? The compliance topics are required only then (see `010`).
2. One monolith endpoint per topic, or one privacy-request endpoint that takes the topic?
3. What does `customers/data_request` produce, and how does it reach the store owner?
4. `app/uninstalled` registered through the API, like today's topics, or declared in the app configuration together
   with the compliance topics?
5. Which monolith records hold the customer's personal data (orders, supplier orders, invoices), and which of them must
   be kept for bookkeeping rather than redacted?
