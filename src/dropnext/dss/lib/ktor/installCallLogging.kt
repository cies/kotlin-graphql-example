/**
 * Always installed, because it is what puts the trace id in the MDC: with an MDC entry configured, Ktor
 * wraps the rest of the pipeline in `MDCContext`, so the id survives every suspension point and reaches the
 * `StatusPages` handler too. The MDC is thread-local and a suspended handler resumes on whatever thread is
 * free; a plain `MDC.put` would only cover the log lines before the first outbound call.
 *
 * The one-line-per-request log is a separate matter, on in `DSS_MODE=DEV` only (the [enabled] filter). The
 * monolith draws the same line with its `MONOLITH_MODE`: its request log and query log exist in `DEV` and not
 * in `PROD`, for the same reason — useful while working on a webhook, noise in production.
 *
 * The format is spelled out rather than left to the plugin's default, which logs the full URI: the OAuth
 * callback carries `code` and `hmac` in its query string, and those are credentials. Method, path and
 * status are what a developer needs; the trace id is on the line through the MDC.
