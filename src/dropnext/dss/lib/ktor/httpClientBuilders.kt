 * seconds still covers a cold connection pool or a GC pause. The bound that decides it is the monolith's

 * is safe; a timed-out call is not repeated because the time budget, not the outcome, is what ran out, and
 * three more attempts would only hold the request longer. Shopify Graphql and OAuth traffic keep the base
 * [createSharedHttpClient]: its mutations carry no idempotency key, so a retried `fulfillmentCreate` would ship
 * the same parcel twice.
 *
 * It also forwards the request's trace id, read from the coroutine context the server's `CallId` plugin
 * fills, so the monolith's log lines for a call can be found from ours. Shopify does not get the header.
 * The OkHttp engine and connection pool are shared.
