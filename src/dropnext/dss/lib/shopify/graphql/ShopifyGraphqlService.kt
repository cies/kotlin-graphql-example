/**
 * Per-shop Shopify Admin API surface. Handlers and workflows program against this interface;
 * production wires [HttpShopifyGraphqlService] (real Graphql over HTTPS, per-shop access token);
 * tests wire `FakeShopifyGraphqlService` (in-memory stubs).
 *
 * Each instance is bound to a single [shop] — the per-shop access token is injected at
 * construction and never leaks back across the API.
 *
 * Methods are **single-shot Graphql primitives**, one per `.graphql` file, and everyone answers a [ShopifyResult]:
 * the transport failure, the top-level Graphql errors, and a mutation payload's `userErrors`
 * are all triaged once, here, so no caller has to know the wire shape.
 * Multistep orchestrations (scan-then-register, load-then-create) live as workflow functions under
 * `dropnext.dss.workflow.*` and compose these primitives.
