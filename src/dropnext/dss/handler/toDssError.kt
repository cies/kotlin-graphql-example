/**
 * Maps a Shopify failure onto the HTTP answer: what Shopify refused is the caller's problem, a
 * refused token is ours to fix by reinstalling, what failed on the way is upstream.
 *
 * An upstream failure is a `502` whether or not a retry can fix it ([ShopifyError.isRetryable]). The monolith retries a
 * `5xx` into its dead-letter queue, where the message waits to be replayed once the cause is fixed, and drops a `4xx` for
 * good; a missing scope or a query Shopify will not run is not the caller's fault, so it gets the answer that keeps it.
