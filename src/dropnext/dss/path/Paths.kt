/**
 * Inbound HTTP paths this service exposes. Single source of truth for route definitions,
 * log strings, UI text, and the `/webhooks/shopify` callback URL we register with Shopify.
 *
 * Canonical contract for DSS-internal endpoints: `src/resources/monolith-dss-openapi.json` (the checked-in
 * copy of the spec the monolith serves at `/openapi.json`).
 * Keep these in sync with the spec — [dropnext.dss.lib.monolith.OutBoundMonolithPaths] is generated
 * from it; see [dropnext.dss.lib.shopify.oauth.OutBoundShopifyOAuthPaths] for the other outbound paths.
